## Project 3 Title : Visualization-Website-Project 3

_________________________________________________________________________

# **Overview**
- ### In Project 3, our group created a data visualization rather than a data analysis, and it allows us to show what we've learned in our boot camp class from up to this point of the course! In this project, we've build a website that allows the user to investigate an explore a particular topic and in our case selecting name of a country. We also build a database and Flask server that works behind the scenes to make the website run smoothly. 

- ### Our group used 2 csv files and the links are provided below, one is the Unemployment dataset and the second one is the Alcohol Consumption from all over the world for the recorded year 2010.

- ### Please create the repository to your desktop and clone it and then follow the instructions below.

## **Instructions**

 1. Create a new repository project called *Visualization-Website-Project 3*. 

 2. Clone the new repository to your computer's desktop then add your notebook files, Data file and your Flask app to the repo.

 3. Push the above changes to GitHub.

 4. Open a GitBash (Window) or Terminal (Mac) to the *Visualization-Website-Project 3* repo, and activate *PythonData38* then type 'Jupyter Notebook' and hit Enter. to clean both   datasets using jupyter notebook. for the ETL process, we filtered columns in Unemployment dataset to only use the recorded year 2010 since Alcohol Consumption has only values for the recorded year 2010. 

 5 . Once step two has completed, open PgAdmin to access PostgreSQL. Create a database called *AlcoholUnemployment_db*.

 6. Open a query tool in the database, and then open the *Schema.sql* file from the repository.

 7. On the GitBash or command console type in Flask run and it will tell you which port it's running on you can go to the app. Don't close this window.
